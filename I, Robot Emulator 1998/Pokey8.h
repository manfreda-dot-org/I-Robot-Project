/* As an alternative to using the exact frequencies, selecting a playback
   frequency that is an exact division of the main clock provides a higher
   quality output due to less aliasing.  For best results, a value of
   1787520 MHz is used for the main clock.  With this value, both the
   64 kHz and 15 kHz clocks are evenly divisible.  Selecting a playback
   frequency that is also a division of the clock provides the best
   results.  The best options are FREQ_64 divided by either 2, 3, or 4.
   The best selection is based on a trade off between performance and
   sound quality.

   Of course, using a main clock frequency that is not exact will affect
   the pitch of the output.  With these numbers, the pitch will be low
   by 0.127%.  (More than likely, an actual unit will vary by this much!) */
