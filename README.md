I, Robot 2020
Verion 1.01

https://github.com/manfreda-dot-org/I-Robot-Project

Modern emulation for 1984 Atari coin-op "I, Robot"

This is my attempt to make a "definitive" high-resolution version of the
emulator.  This version makes full use of modern graphics card features and
anti-aliasing.

A number of cheats / hacks have been built into the game.  Check the menus.


ROMS:

You will need a copy of the original I, Robot ROMs to use this emulator. The
standard MAME ROMset can be used.  Place your ROMs are in a file called
"irobot.zip" and put the zip file in the same directory as the emulator.
