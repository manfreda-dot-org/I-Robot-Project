I, Robot 2020
Verion 1.01

https://github.com/manfreda-dot-org/I-Robot-Project

Modern emulation for 1984 Atari coin-op "I, Robot"

This is my attempt to make the "definitive" high-resolution version of the
emulator.  This version makes full use of modern graphics card features and
anti-aliasing.

For comparison here is the original game:

And here is the equivalent in high res
